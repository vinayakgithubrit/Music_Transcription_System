Music Transcription System
Project Overview
The Music Transcription System is designed to analyze monophonic audio inputs and generate real-time musical accompaniments. It utilizes an FPGA-based hardware platform, specifically the PYNQ-Z2 board, to ensure efficient signal processing with minimal latency. By leveraging advanced signal processing techniques, the system extracts key musical features such as pitch, rhythm, melody, and harmony from input audio and translates them into structured musical representations.

Unlike traditional transcription systems that rely on offline processing, this project emphasizes real-time computation, making it suitable for live performances, music education, and composition. The integration of hardware acceleration through FPGA allows for parallel processing, significantly reducing delays compared to software-based solutions.

Hardware Used
PYNQ-Z2 FPGA Board – Used for real-time signal processing and hardware acceleration.
Microphone Module – Captures monophonic audio inputs for analysis.
MIDI Output Interface – Provides flexibility for music composition and playback.
Python Libraries and Tools Used
The system is implemented using Python with various libraries for digital signal processing and machine learning:

NumPy & SciPy – For numerical computations and signal processing.
Librosa – Used for audio feature extraction (pitch detection, onset detection, and tempo estimation).
Matplotlib – To visualize waveforms, spectrograms, and frequency components.
PyTorch/TensorFlow (Optional) – For deep learning-based pitch and rhythm analysis.
PYNQ API – Facilitates communication between the FPGA and Python for hardware-accelerated processing.
MIDIUtil – For generating MIDI outputs.
Key Techniques Implemented
Pitch Detection:

Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Autocorrelation to determine fundamental frequencies.
Implements Fourier Tempograms for tempo estimation.
Rhythm and Beat Tracking:

Uses self-similarity matrices to identify note onsets and transitions.
Applies adaptive windowing for dynamic tempo adjustments.
Chord Recognition and Harmonization:

Employs rule-based harmonization and template-based chord matching to generate accompanying chords.
Applications
Live Performances – Enables real-time musical accompaniment.
Music Education – Helps students analyze and understand musical compositions.
Composition & Production – Assists composers in creating harmonized musical pieces.
This system provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for automatic music transcription, offering real-time processing, intelligent harmonization, and flexible output formats (MIDI & audio) for musicians and developers.
